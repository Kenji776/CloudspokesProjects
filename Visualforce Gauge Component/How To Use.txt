To begin using the visualforce gauge component: 

1) Upload the static resource into your org. Call it 'vf_guage' (without quotes).
2) Create a component and put the code from the component file in there.
3) Create a visualforce page, use the included page as an example. Simply set the standard controller as whatever object you want this 
component to be on. Include values for the arguments (maximum and current value will likeyl be taken from the object).
4) Edit the page layout of the object. The visualforce page section should be available. Drag the page into the page layout.

Your visualforce page should now show the gauge component.

One thing to note:
Only attributes without default values can be passed in dynamically. Meaning if you want to pass in a value to the component 
(like we do with the maximum, minimum and current values) you must not have a default on the attribute tag in the component. So
go to the component and remove the default value attribute, then you should be able to pass in a value from the visualforce page
using {!objectType.field}.
