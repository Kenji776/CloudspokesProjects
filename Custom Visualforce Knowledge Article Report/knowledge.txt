Knowledge - Custom Visualforce Knowledge Article Report
Kenji776

Knowledge is a visualforce/jQuery powered application to report on, and export knowledge articles from salesforce.
It supports data categories and article types for filtering, as well as as many custom filters as you like.

To install, simple copy the pages, static resource, and class into your org. Sorry, due to a salseforce limitation, no
package is available at this time.

Once installed, just navigate to /apex/knowledge in your org. The program should detect all categories, types, and available fields.
You may need to allow it to access unsecured resources so it can get the jQuery ui styles.

You may include as many data categories in the filtering as you like, and with the live query editor you can customize the selection criteria to 
exactly what you'd like.

You can also export the category types related to knowledge articles by dragging them onto the report. Finding the categories for an article
is a processing intensive task, so it is not recommended to be added unless required. When reporting on the categories for articles the articleType
field is required and will be added automatically. If it is removed from the report all category fields will be removed as well.
